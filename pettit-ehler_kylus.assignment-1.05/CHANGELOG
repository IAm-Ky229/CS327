Mar 16: Added curses library to program, got everything printing with mvaddch. Also got mvaddstr working. Buffered input with a halfdelay of 0.1 seconds seems to be allowing the program to update in the background, while retaining any user input. Will work on refactoring so that we can move to different maps tomorrow.

Mar 17: Refactored characters to be stored in each map. PC can now move, and hikers/rivals shortest paths are updated properly. Probably gonna work on moving to and generating different maps tomorrow.

Mar 18: Traversing right and left works, but sometimes rivals and hikers stop moving. Traversing up and down doesn't work yet. Still need to implement a placeholder for the mart/centers, and a list of all characters in the map.

Mar 19: Fixed upwards and downwards traversing. I still can't figure out why dijkstra's isn't working sometimes, it's like my code fails to insert the first node, leaving the whole distance array initialized to INT_MAX. There are also some extreme cases where rivals/hikers get next to the PC, and stop moving as well. This is honestly more acceptable, as they have never stopped in the middle of their pathfinding. I will continue to look into it though.

Tried to fix hikers and rivals pathing towards the PC when the PC is in a mart or center, mostly (but not entirely) fixed the issues. Really, the only time things break is when there is a horde of hikers / rivals outside the center. Last thing to do is implement a list of the current characters on screen
