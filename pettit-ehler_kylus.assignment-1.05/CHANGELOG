Mar 16: Added curses library to program, got everything printing with mvaddch. Also got mvaddstr working. Buffered input with a halfdelay of 0.1 seconds seems to be allowing the program to update in the background, while retaining any user input. Will work on refactoring so that we can move to different maps tomorrow.

Mar 17: Refactored characters to be stored in each map. PC can now move, and hikers/rivals shortest paths are updated properly. Probably gonna work on moving to and generating different maps tomorrow.

Mar 18: Traversing right and left works, but sometimes rivals and hikers stop moving. Traversing up and down doesn't work yet. Still need to implement a placeholder for the mart/centers, and a list of all characters in the map.

Mar 19: Fixed upwards and downwards traversing
