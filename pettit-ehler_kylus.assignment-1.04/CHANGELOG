Feb 23: Tried to put distance calculation stuff into its own c and h file but I kept getting header errors. I dunno what I'm doing wrong but I bet it's simple. Got a really simple start, just setting up the 2-D character array and trying to figure out how to do the movement.

Feb 24: Got started with printing out all characters. Am able to place 10 characters within each map I generate, now to start moving them.

Feb 25: Characters all printed. Getting started on movement with Pacers, and implementing the actual game time cycle

Feb 27: Getting pacers to move a bit, but getting a lot of seg faults

Feb 28: Pacers can move up and down now! It shouldn't be too hard to implement walkers now, so I'll focus on hikers / rivals. I can't get them to move right now

Mar 1: Finally got some movement for rivals. Gonna work more on it tomorrow, as they're seg faulting

Mar 2: Rivals and hikers now pathfind to the PC. Also figured out the pacer problems I was having. So the rest shouldn't be too bad (famous last words)

Mar 5: Pacers can go right and left if need be. Getting started on moving random walkers, and wanderers, the last two. I just need to correctly turn them randomly. Then try to fix a few other bugs that popped up

Mar 6: Everybody moves but I'm still getting some strange bugs with the hiker/rival and the wanderers/walkers. I also have a lot of similar code, but I think a lot of it needs to be that way because the subtle character movement differences are not easy to fit into one method. I'll begin looking at the bugs either later today or tomorrow.

Mar 7: Resolved some bugs, still have to implement the --numtrainers switch, probably gonna do that tomorrow. Still have a few bugs with movement, but if nobody collides excessively everything seems to be working

Mar 8: Fixed the majority of the remaining bugs. Also implemented the numtrainers switch. Do the readme, cleanup code, and submit
