Feb 23: Tried to put distance calculation stuff into its own c and h file but I kept getting header errors. I dunno what I'm doing wrong but I bet it's simple. Got a really simple start, just setting up the 2-D character array and trying to figure out how to do the movement.

Feb 24: Got started with printing out all characters. Am able to place 10 characters within each map I generate, now to start moving them.

Feb 25: Characters all printed. Getting started on movement with Pacers, and implementing the actual game time cycle
