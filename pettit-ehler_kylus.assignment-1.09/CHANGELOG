Apr 24: Got tired of waiting for 1.09 spec, implemented pokemon centers and marts. You can buy pokeballs, revives, and potions at marts. And you have the choice of fully healing all pokemon at centers. Just discovered a bug when the PC moves along the edges of the map, that crash the game. I have no idea what is causing it.
