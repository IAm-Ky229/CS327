Apr 24: Got tired of waiting for 1.09 spec, implemented pokemon centers and marts. You can buy pokeballs, revives, and potions at marts. And you have the choice of fully healing all pokemon at centers. Just discovered a bug when the PC moves along the edges of the map, that crash the game. I have no idea what is causing it.

Apr 25: Fixed the PC moving along the edges bug! Somehow my Dijkstra bounds checking was going outside of the map? I have no idea. All I know is it runs now. If I didn't know any better, I think that was the bug causing all of the Rivals and Hikers to randomly stand still as well...
