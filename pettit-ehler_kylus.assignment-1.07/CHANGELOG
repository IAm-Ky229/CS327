Mar 31: I can't belive it, but I can't figure out this linker issue. I keep getting redefinition errors, no matter what I do. I'm probably gonna have to go to office hours to get it resolved.

I might be figuring out the dependency issue. It's been defined multiple times somewhere, so I just have to find the place where it should be defined once for all files needing it. Easier said than done.

Made a class for the in-game pokemon to be displayed, and a class for the wild pokemon spawning logic.

Pokemon now have a 10% chance of appearing in tall grass. They are chosen uniformly when a they appear. Will implement stats and such sometime later.

Apr 1: Stats are now fetched, calculated, and displayed along with pokemon moves and level. Given that we have parsed in all the files we need, of course. Will probably work on making levels dynamic with manhattan distance later.

Still need to figure out how to resolve the moves version group ID issue, there isn't an ID that encapsulates all pokemon.

Small rant about C++ pointers:
I also just discovered a pretty bad bug plaguing my 1.06 submission. Apparently, C int pointer values are initialized to 0, but C++ pointer values are not. So, the battled value for any NPC in my 1.06 submission will probably not start out at 0, meaning they can never be battled. If you'd like to laugh at my misfortune more, I tested a battle with the re-factored C++ code (that is not guaranteed to initialize the pointer to 0) before submission. And by random chance, it was initialized to 0, so I assumed the battle functionality worked. All the times I've tried now, the battle functionality is completely broken. April fools
