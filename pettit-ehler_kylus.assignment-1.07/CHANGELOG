Mar 31: I can't belive it, but I can't figure out this linker issue. I keep getting redefinition errors, no matter what I do. I'm probably gonna have to go to office hours to get it resolved.

I might be figuring out the dependency issue. It's been defined multiple times somewhere, so I just have to find the place where it should be defined once for all files needing it. Easier said than done.

Made a class for the in-game pokemon to be displayed, and a class for the wild pokemon spawning logic.

Pokemon now have a 10% chance of appearing in tall grass. They are chosen uniformly when a they appear. Will implement stats and such sometime later.

Apr 1: Stats are now fetched, calculated, and displayed along with pokemon moves and level. Given that we have parsed in all the files we need, of course. Will probably work on making levels dynamic with manhattan distance later.

Still need to figure out how to resolve the moves version group ID issue, there isn't an ID that encapsulates all pokemon.

Apr 4: Implemented dynamic levels, gender, and shiny chance. The moves ID issue was resolved by just choosing from the most populated version IDs, starting at 15. That's the best workaround I can find for now. Unless Jeremy explicitly tells us to do something.

For now, I'm going to filter wild pokemon moves to only be chosen from their learned moveset. Not TMs, HMs, or egg moves. This is to avoid getting Quagsires that know Giga Impact and Earthquake on the first map.

Do README, will probably submit later.

Apr 5: Finally figured out the linker problem and split my program up into a handful of appropriately named files. Refactor my readme a bit, fix a bug with PC engaging in battles and submit. Actually there's not an assignment up for 1.07 on Canvas yet, that's odd considering it's due tomorrow. I'm probably gonna forget to submit it ngl

Apr 6: Submit. I'm not sure if we are meant to have a true "capture" sequence, I'm not going to add one for now because I could just process a "c" keypress or something to take you to a screen that says "You caught <pokemon>." And I feel like the bulk of the assignment was just parsing all the moves and stats and stuff
