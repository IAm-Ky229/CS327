# CS327
Computer Science 327 primarily served to help me learn a memory managed language. In the first half I coded in C, and in the second half I coded in C++. This semester
introduced a new type of project for the class (Pokemon RPG), so the weekly assignments posed some challenges that the instructor did not foresee. In each assignment directory, you'll find a document describing the specifications for that assignment. There is also a CHANGELOG and README submitted with every assignment to document
how the project has progressed from the previous assignment.
