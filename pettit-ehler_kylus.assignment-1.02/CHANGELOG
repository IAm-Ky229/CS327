Feb 3: Got started, refactored my old map generation code so that everything is stored in a struct. Got simple character scanning working in a while loop.

Feb 4: Refactored code so that my functions are updating a struct. Have some basic map generation working for each direction. Still need to add bounds checking, connecting exits properly, and building spawn rate changes.

Feb 6: Roads now properly connect with each other. Also implemented building spawn rates. Still gotta implement some edge cases near the edge of the map, and bounds checking in general.

Feb 8: Handled edge cases and bounds checking. Fixed a few problems that I found (not resetting exit variables, incorrectly closing off edges of map, building spawn rate being negative). Submitted.
